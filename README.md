## Team Members and Roles

### Alexandre Hachey - Team lead / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student with several years of part-time and full-time work experience in the tech industry. I have worked in an Agile team
and am confident in leading my team to follow this methodology. I have worked as a Full-Stack developer touching a variety of technologies, implementing
projects using languages and frameworks such as C# .NET, Python, Typescript/Javascript, Angular, React, Golang, Zig, HTMX, and several more. My role in
this project will be to manage the task delegation and project deadlines within the team while working on features and coordinating the team.

### J. David Ruiz / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student at Concordia. I have experience in building large scale website applications using React.
I also love programming in Python and Java. I have worked at Bombardier and Intact as software developper. In this project I will be
working in the front and backend. 

### Yan Pilon - Developer / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student at Concordia who specializes in Full-Stack development using Vue.js, Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB as a main stack but who also has experience with various other languages and frameworks such as: Java, Python, C#, Angular.js and others. I will be mainly working on feature implementation but I will also be helping coordinating members who have less experience with web technologies/development.

### Mohammad Natsheh
I am a computer engineer at Concordia with experience programming in lower level languages such as x86 and arm assembly as well as java and C++. I have previously worked using the agile methodology with a previous project involving the development of an Android application. I have worked with databases including Firebase and some SQL experience. I will be working on the front end for this project using typescript.

### David Jordan Mateus
I am a software engineering student at Concordia university who over my summer intership specialized in AI, specifically in neural network creation. I have most my experience creating neural networks in python. I am also confortable using Java, JavaScript, C#, CSS and more. Due to having taking web design in the past I will also be confortable creating the website. I will be working more so on front end and design of the website.

 2.2 Project Timeline
- Sprint 1 - February 12
  - Decide framework
  - Populate Team Members and Roles readme
  - Populate Approach and Technology readme
  - Create 6 user stories
  - Work on team log and wiki
  - Plan Sprint 2
- Sprint 2 - March 11
- Sprint 3 - March 25
- Sprint 4 - April 10
 
 2.3 Collaboration and Communication
- The team will meet regularly in person for short amount of time (15 min). We will also meet on Fridays for longer periods (1-2 hours) to work together. Lastly, all the communication will be done through a discord server.
