## Description
Repository to work on the car rental web project. Allows users to browse and reserve vehicles, to cancel reservations, to review them and much more. 

## Installation instructions and Usage Guidelines

### Installation
To get started working on this repository, you can run the following command in your terminal of choice

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GitExcited/MRE-soen341projectW2024/
```
There are no further installation instructions for the time being as the frontend and backend applications have not been initialized in the repository at the current time.

### Usage guidelines
Branch Protection: To contribute to the repository, developers need to make a branch, commit to the branch, and merge to the main branch through a pull request when ready.

Pull Request Approvals: Every pull request attempting to merge to the main branch must be reviewed by atleast 2 other contributors before being merged.

CI Pipeline: Over the course of sprint 2, the Jest testing framework will be used to enforce tests on the code to verify integrity of our logic and syntax. There will also be lint checks from ESLint rules and Prettier to enforce consistend code style.

Additional Rules: 
- User stories must follow the template found [here](https://github.com/GitExcited/MRE-soen341projectW2024/blob/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/user-story.md)
- Pull requests must follow the template found [here](https://github.com/GitExcited/MRE-soen341projectW2024/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md)
- User stories must be broken down into their tasks in their own issues.
- For any additional information about feature implementation statuses, consult our [Sprint Planning](https://github.com/GitExcited/MRE-soen341projectW2024/wiki/Sprint-Planning) section of our [wiki](https://github.com/GitExcited/MRE-soen341projectW2024/wiki)
- For any additional information about the technology and project approach, consult the [Project Approach and Technology Stack](https://github.com/GitExcited/MRE-soen341projectW2024/blob/main/Sprint%201/Project-Approach-and-Technology-Stack-Selection.md) 

## Team Members and Roles

### Alexandre Hachey - Team lead / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student with several years of part-time and full-time work experience in the tech industry. I have worked in an Agile team
and am confident in leading my team to follow this methodology. I have worked as a Full-Stack developer touching a variety of technologies, implementing
projects using languages and frameworks such as C# .NET, Python, Typescript/Javascript, Angular, React, Golang, Zig, HTMX, and several more. My role in
this project will be to manage the task delegation and project deadlines within the team while working on features and coordinating the team.

### J. David Ruiz / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student at Concordia. I have experience in building large scale website applications using React.
I also love programming in Python and Java. I have worked at Bombardier and Intact as a software developper. In this project I will be
working in the front and backend. 

### Yan Pilon - Developer / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student at Concordia who specializes in Full-Stack development using Vue.js, Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB as a main stack but who also has experience with various other languages and frameworks such as: Java, Python, C#, Angular.js and others. I will be mainly working on feature implementation but I will also be helping coordinating members who have less experience with web technologies/development.

### Mohammad Natsheh /Front-End
I am a computer engineer student at Concordia with experience programming in lower level languages such as x86 and arm assembly as well as java and C++. I have previously worked using the agile methodology with a previous project involving the development of an Android application. I have worked with databases including Firebase and some SQL experience. I will be working on the front end for this project using typescript.

### David Jordan Mateus / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student at Concordia University who over my summer internship specialized in AI, specifically in neural network creation. Most of my experience is in creating neural networks in Python. I am also comfortable using Java, JavaScript, C#, CSS, and more. Due to having taken web design in the past, I will also be comfortable creating the website. I will be working more so on the front end and design of the website. My goal is to make this project a learning experience and something to be proud of.

### Rishit Mittal / Full Stack
I am a computer engineering student at Concordia university who specialized in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI specifically in neural network such as CNN over my 8 month internship. I have experience using SDK with C/C++, Java, Python and lower level language such as x86 assembly. I have some experience in creating a webpage using HTML, CSS and I would be working on the front end using vue.js and would be helping out in the backend too.
