## Team Members and Roles

### Alexandre Hachey - Team lead / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student with several years of part-time and full-time work experience in the tech industry. I have worked in an Agile team
and am confident in leading my team to follow this methodology. I have worked as a Full-Stack developer touching a variety of technologies, implementing
projects using languages and frameworks such as C# .NET, Python, Typescript/Javascript, Angular, React, Golang, Zig, HTMX, and several more. My role in
this project will be to manage the task delegation and project deadlines within the team while working on features and coordinating the team.

### J. David Ruiz / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student at Concordia. I have experience in building large scale website applications using React.
I also love programming in Python and Java. I have worked at Bombardier and Intact as a software developper. In this project I will be
working in the front and backend. 

### Yan Pilon - Developer / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student at Concordia who specializes in Full-Stack development using Vue.js, Express.js, Node.js and MongoDB as a main stack but who also has experience with various other languages and frameworks such as: Java, Python, C#, Angular.js and others. I will be mainly working on feature implementation but I will also be helping coordinating members who have less experience with web technologies/development.

### Mohammad Natsheh /Front-End
I am a computer engineer student at Concordia with experience programming in lower level languages such as x86 and arm assembly as well as java and C++. I have previously worked using the agile methodology with a previous project involving the development of an Android application. I have worked with databases including Firebase and some SQL experience. I will be working on the front end for this project using typescript.

### David Jordan Mateus / Full Stack
I am a software engineering student at Concordia University who over my summer internship specialized in AI, specifically in neural network creation. Most of my experience is in creating neural networks in Python. I am also comfortable using Java, JavaScript, C#, CSS, and more. Due to having taken web design in the past, I will also be comfortable creating the website. I will be working more so on the front end and design of the website. My goal is to make this project a learning experience and something to be proud of.

### Rishit Mittal
I am a computer engineering student at Concordia university who specialized in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI specifically in neural network such as CNN over my 8 month internship. I have experience using SDK with C/C++, Java, Python and lower level language such as x86 assembly. I have some experience in creating a webpage using HTML, CSS and I would be working on the front end using vue.js and would be helping out in the backend too.
